# A.C.R.O.N.Y.M.
A program that I developed that serves a decorative purpose. While it isn't inherently useful for productivity or creativity like most of my other hobbies, it serves as a good base for a helper class for stylized printing and miscellaneous texts in a program's command terminal. I hope to use the program as a fun feature, which I feel most of my programs lack, but especially as a buffer once my programs begin to get more expansive. I am currently working on a music oriented program - C.R.E.S.C.E.N.D.O. - which utilizes Python libraries that can be time consuming to run; even I get distracted waiting to run a single commmand as I develop the program. So I wish to wipe that dread from the user experience with this program. The concept was based off the intro to every episode of my favorite cartoon Codename: Kids Next Door where, in every episode, the episode's title which usually consists of an acronym is transmitted. The acronym name and content serves as a description of the episode. I want that same idea for my programs, which is why I rebranded all my program names as acronyms. I hope you enjoy and maximize the capabilities of my code as much as I have, should you choose to use or revamp it. 

**To utilize the program properly, please store the .wav files in a separate folder named "Transmission Audios" relative to the A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. Demo program.**
