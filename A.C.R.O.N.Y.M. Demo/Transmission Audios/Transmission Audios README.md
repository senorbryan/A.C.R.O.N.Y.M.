These are the audio files for the A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. program. I've spliced the audio that's played during specific parts of [the intro that this program was based off](https://youtu.be/ZcLhESBgLfo?si=vXi5d9PPfR56ghjB&t=25 "Codename: Kids Next Door Intro").
I've spliced the audio files to have them continuously run for their respective purpose. This was done to assure audio syncing with the transmission compared to using a standard audio file,
as acronym length and typing speed can vary which would lead to inaccuarte audio syncing.
